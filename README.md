# README.md file for run_analysis.R

The run_analysis.R file contains lines of code to perform multiple activities related to obtaining a tidy data.

The data that were provided for this project were collected from multiple subjects performing different activities such as walking, standing, laying ...
This data was divided in multiple datasets and contains variable names that were not descritptive.

As instructed, the run_analysis.R R script will download the raw data sets, combine them, rename the variables with descriptive variable names, select only the variables representing the mean and the standard deviation, and finally compute the the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Comments are inserted throughout the script to explain what each line of code is doing.

The data sets will be downloaded and save in the current/working directory of the R or RStudio program.
